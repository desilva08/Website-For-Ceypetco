                    The Corporation commenced business in competition with other Oil Companies who were operating in the country at that time.</h5>
                  <p>1964
                    The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation took over the entire business of import, sale and distribution of petroleum products within the country.
                    The Kolonnawa Oil Installation, regional bulk depots and retail outlets which operated under three different oil companies prior to nationalization was subject to several transformations and improvements of their facilities to perform its operations as one entity. Since then, new bulk depots / retail outlets were constructed and storage capacity of Kolonnawa Installation & regional depots were increased. A Fire & Safety Division was set up in Kolonnawa Installation with the introduction of a new fire hydrant systems and the internal road network was improved to facilitate operational and maintenance activities. The gantry filling facility was improved to suit replenishment of large capacity bowsers introduced in mid 90 s</p>
